    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <body> 
        <p>What I am looking to learn in this coarse</p>
        <p>I am trying to learn how to code. I want to be able to recognize
            broken links and be able to fix them. I want to have a good understanding
            of padding and margin layout. I want to be able to link multiple pages
            and have them actually work. I want to be able to create drop down menus.
        <p>I want to be confident in my css skills, java and java script. I am embracing learning an 
          new skill and look forward to learning. I feel like throwing my computer across my living room
          but i know this is going to pay off. 
        <p>Taking these courses are actually stressful and that's coming from someone that works in a state penitentiary.
          I enjoy the attention to detail that coding takes. I never thought about how much work goes into a basic web page. 
          I am excited about learning something new and becoming a professional.
