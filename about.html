<h2>About Myself</h2>
<body> 
    
<p> I am a U.S. Army veteran. I use to jump out of high performance air crafts while in flight for the 
    82nd Airborne Division. I enjoy long walks on the beach and love curling up with a good book.I love my three rescue
    dogs and taking them for walks on Sundays. I enjoy reading self help books and becoming a better person than I was yesterday.
    The current book I am reading is Think and Grow Rich. The current skill set that I am going to acquire is going to put 
    me on the path to create my dreams into reality. 
<p> I am currently work for the State of California as a Corrections officer. I have been in my profession for 22 years. God willing, I will be retiring in about 6 years and look forward
    to starting a new career in coding and cyber security. I look forward to starting a new chapter in my life and providing for my 3 children that are college bound.
 <p>I want to be an example to my children and show them a new skill can be learned at any age. I want to show them that change is constantly happening and the only thing an 
    individual can do is to embrace it. I want them to see that hard work pays off at any age and it's never to late to reinvent yourself as an individual.
