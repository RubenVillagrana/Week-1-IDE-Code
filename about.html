<p> I am a U.S. Army veteran. I use to jump out of high performance air crafts while in flight for the 
    82nd Airborne Division. I enjoy long walks on the beach and love curling up with a good book.I love my three rescue
    dogs and taking them for walks on Sundays. I enjoy reading self help books and becoming a better person than I was yesterday.
    The current book I am reading is Think and Grow Rich. The current skill set that I am going to acquire is going to put 
    me on the path create my dreams into reality.
